**TL;DR** I share how to create a highly portable jekyll development environment. `git-clone` your website repository and run `docker-compose up` üöÄ

## Motivation

Normally, Jekyll requires a full Ruby development environment. This isn't hard to setup, and the steps are described [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). This is fine and good, but I wanted a fully portable environment without having to install Ruby or Bundler. For this I thought [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a good solution. This way, the only thing that needs to be installed wherever I am working on the site is Docker itself.

## Docker

Docker is a platform that uses virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. These containers are significantly more lightweight than full-blown virtual machines, as [OS-level virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization) is used.

## docker-compose

`docker-compose` is a command-line utility to work with `docker-compose.yml` files. Docker compose can be used to quickly define and run multi-container Docker applications with a single command and configuration file. A `docker-compose.yml` file contains everything from image configuration, network configuration, and commands to run when the containers start.

Read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Jekyll docker-compose

For my personal site, I want a local development environment that is highly portable - ideally as easy as `git clone`-ing the repository and running `docker-compose up`. That's exactly what the `docker-compose.yml` file below does üëç.

```yml
version: '3'                        # docker-compose file format. Ex. 1, 2, or 3.
                                    # Different versions work with different versions of Docker, and support different features

services:                           # Configs for the various services, we just have one
  jekyll:
    image: jekyll/jekyll:latest     # Image name to pull from Docker Hub
    command: jekyll serve --livereload     # Command to run when the container starts
    ports:
      - 4000:4000                   # Map local port 4000 to port 4000 in the container
      - 35729:35729                 # We need to specify another port for the Jekyll 3.70+ live reload feature
    volumes:
      - ./src:/srv/jekyll           # Mount a volume so the container can access local data in the src directory
```

Let's break down the compose file.  

- The `services` mapping is where we define our containers. In YAML, a mapping is basically a collection of key:value pairs. We can call each container what we'd like, and in this case we only have one - "jekyll"

- The `image` entry tells Docker what image to use. We could roll our own with a `Dockerfile`, but there is a nice official Jekyll image available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll/) that we can use.

- With the `command` entry, we can override the default command in the image.

- The `ports` sequence defines what ports to hook up from the container. The bundled web server in the image listens on port 4000, so we map this to our machine's port 4000. We could choose a different one, ex: `3999:4000`

- The `volumes` sequence defines what persistent data to connect to the container and where to mount it. In this case, I have my Jekyll source files in the `src` subdirectory.

Let's look at the `command` entry a little more closely. We can see that it passing some arguments to the jekyll command line tool:

- `serve` builds your site and serves it locally using bundled web server.

- `--livereload` is very cool, it reloads your browser window when you make changes to your source files. Very handy for development.

### Livereload

Introduced with Jekyll 3.7.0, this feature will auto re-generate the pages corresponding with your edits, and trigger your browser window to refresh (should you be previewing the site). Without this, you would have to use the `--watch` option and manually refresh the browser page to get the latest changes - but that's one more click and you have to switch focus to your browser üòõ One thing to note though, at least on Safari I've found that when the page refreshes there's a good chance that you lose your scroll position.

Also note that this feature works by injecting a new JavaScript file, `livereload.js`. This file listens for messages on port 35729, and will refresh the page when Jekyll re-generates a file. This is why we have to specify an extra port in our compose file.

## Workflow

Typically when working on the site, I will have an editor (VSCode for me), and a browser pointing to `localhost:4000` side by side. Starting work on the site is as simple as running `docker-compose up` üëç

## Closing Remarks

Note that `jekyll serve` is only meant for use for development purposes. The web server that it uses is not meant to handle multiple incoming requests, and should really not be used in production. For deployment, I'd recommend running `jekyll build` and using a proper web server like NGINX or Apache to serve the site. I'll have another post about this soon üòÄ
