Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm Sebastian. I'm a mobile developer with 4+ years of experience across several platforms. I've worked on Windows with WPF, UWP on Windows 8 and then 10, Android, and since 2018 focusing heavily on iOS development using UIKit and Swift (and â™¥-ing it!). Since 2015 I've been working at [SAP](https://www.sap.com), where I've developed not just mobile apps but also some nifty backend apps too. At SAP, my team creates fun and useful apps for our colleagues to help boost their productivity and inject a little fun into the everyday ðŸ˜Š

What drives me as a developer and software engineer is curiosity - over the years in school and working in the industry I've always made sure to learn that new framework, pick up that shiny new technology, or just try out the latest hip design pattern.

At SAP, I'm focused on creating beautiful and fast native app experiences to help our colleagues run better and improve their daily workflow. Here's a quick look at some of the projects I have been involved in.

#### SAP Campus App

Campus is one of our key apps, enabling lightning-quick access to all kinds of information about their office location. Functionality includes up to date and colorful floor plans of office spaces, a robust global search that works for everything from finding & booking meeting rooms, to locating colleagues' workspaces on a map.

I've worked on both the frontend and backend of the app. On the iOS side, we use technologies/frameworks like MapKit, CoreLocation, and the SAP Fiori SDK for iOS to enable a completely dynamic experience to quickly pan & zoom to many SAP locations worldwide.

The backend is a RESTful API service running on the SAP Cloud Platform. A containerized infrastructure enables quick raster tile delivery, as well as rendering of tiles and CRUD API operations. An intelligent admin interface offers convienient data maintenance, and automated jobs synchronize master data with other internal services for up-to-date data.

#### SAP Academy App

SAP Sillicon Valley is the home of the SAP Sales Academy, a program where we train the next generation of SAP sales colleagues. The Academy App is a key part of the students' experience during the program. It offers functionality to view realtime program scores, an evaluation calendar, collaboration features, and a schedule builder.

#### Digital Signage tvOS

At SAP, we have a lot of screens everywhere in the office - often not displaying anything. Digital Signage is our own internal solution to put content on these devices - and an AppleTV is the perfect device for this. At ~$150, Apple TVs are cheap enough to place behind every screen, and have conferencing functionality and app support to boot. They're also easily manageable with MDM.

Our Digital Signage solution supports many media formats, and playlists can be managed in a central place and pushed out to many devices at once.

## Volunteering

Volunteerism is a key part of my who I am.
